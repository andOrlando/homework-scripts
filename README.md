I don't wanna do homework please

Sooo now that I have to pay a bunch of money for homework portals I figured it'd be a good idea to get the least value for my money imaginable by skipping as much of the homework as I physically can. Ideally this repository is just gonna contain a bunch of bookmarks that you can copy and paste into your bookmarks and then do all your homework for you

Perusall Bookmark:
```js
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andOrlando/homework-scripts/main/perusall.js").then(a=>a.text()).then(a=>eval(a))
```
