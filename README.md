I don't wanna do homework please

Sooo now that I have to pay a bunch of money for homework portals I figured it'd be a good idea to get the least value for my money imaginable by skipping as much of the homework as I physically can. Ideally this repository is just gonna contain a bunch of bookmarks that you can copy and paste into your bookmarks and then do all your homework for you

That being said it is kinda executing third party scripts which is like really shady so don't use this if you're worried about that. You could also read the source files (except for perusall becuase for some reason I felt like golfing that one and now its unintelligable)

**zyBooks Bookmark**
```js
```

**Perusall Bookmark**
```js
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andOrlando/homework-scripts/main/perusall.js").then(a=>a.text()).then(a=>eval(a))
```

- [X] zyBooks (solves everything but the draggy bits and the challenge questions)
- [X] Perusall (only scrolls through page to generate some base points)
- [ ] MyMathLab
